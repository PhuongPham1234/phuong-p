## Is Javascript even good?
My first time learning Javascript was definitely an eye opening experience because the only programming language that I have learned before was Java. The syntax of Javascript was very similar to Java with the exception that in my opinion it is more efficient in terms of the amount of code needed to write for the same action. The majority syntax is the same just that they are worded differently, for example in Javascript it is necessary to declare parameters types in a function using a “:”. I am a total newbie to programming, especially with Javascript. I believe a language like Java or Python should be learned first for people getting into programming because it’s not too hard and it allows one to learn programming on a deeper level. Javascript is a really good language for a little more advanced programmer who already has a fundamental understanding of programming. Javascript is great for athletic software engineering. But what even is athletic software engineering? Athletic software engineering is defined as according to ChatGPT “ an approach to teaching and practicing software engineering that emphasizes active, intensive, and time-constrained exercises, similar to the way athletes train for peak performance.” I think that Javascript is a good programming language that can be incorporated into many different projects. 

## WODs: Wings of Destiny
Going through my first WOD’s (Workout of the Day) made me feel stressed yet hyped to achieve greatness. The WOD’s are rated by the amount of time it takes to successfully solve a programming problem. Rx being really good, Av the average, Std which is the standard, or Dnf which means Did not finish. Being somewhat a person who often gets distracted and side tracked, the timed WOD’s creates a fun learning environment for me that helps develop analytical thinking, problem solving skills, and enhances my focus by putting pressure on time. WOD’s are a good idea to incorporate into other areas in life to improve efficiency. 

## My take on athletic software engineering
I have never heard of athletic software engineering prior to this class. My impression of this style of learning felt pretty fun and rewarding. I envision this to become very effective and helpful for us in our future career. I am excited to do more of the Workouts of the Day!
