## My experience with ESLint

This is the first assignment we had so far with ESLint and I ran the ESLint command on my terminal after I finished all of my code. I was so shocked to find there were so many errors even though my code looks quite alright. I found out that the errors were a lot of indentation errors so it was an easy fix but quite time consuming to go through individual lines to fix the indentation. This is very similar to what I had to do for the ICS 212 coding standard where it’s strict on the indentation of code. This practice has really helped me write code that is a lot more clean and easy to read/understand.

## How Coding Standard Will Help Me

Being able to write good code means to write code that other people can understand easily to better maintain. Coding standard ensures that there is adequate spacing and indentation between lines code. Being able to consistently keep a good coding standard when coding is a crucial habit for any software engineer to develop because it means that code meant to share with others on collaboration projects will be much easier understood. Coding standards can help with writing efficient code because having to keep track of spacing and indentation is a lot of work which encourages code to be written with the fewest lines possible to reduce work. For example choosing the right data structure and algorithm will get rid of unnecessary loops that make code run faster. Coding can really make a difference when debugging because it’s so much to read individual lines of code and trying to understand it when it’s spaced out rather than clumped up together. 

## Overall

Coding standards really enhance my ability to write better code which gives me more confidence in my programming skills. It gives a guideline to follow everytime I code which helps me be more organized and write code that other people will understand makes me look like a better programmer. I will continue to apply coding standard practice in my daily coding practice which will eventually help me in my jobs and so forth.
